#Week 4 : Pomodoro

##Presentation :
We had to replicate a __Pomodoro__ using Jquery.

##What's inside :
__index.html__ : I used div + button tags only.  
__main.css__ : Only a few flex declarations to position everything.  
__main.js__ : Functions to change step (session/break) and animate the progression.

##How ?  
Mostly JQuery + DOM
